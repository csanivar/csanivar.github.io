So I revived this blog last week and so I wanted to updated it again to keep it from getting inactive and dying.
I have been journaling lately[1] but I am not too open to post all that here, and so I wanted to post some of the things I found this previous week.<br>


## Music
I found the following through YouTube Music recommendations while listening to Tigran Hamasyan and I have been listening to these all week.  
- [Mammal Hands - Boreal Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmjFJd6q4Es)
- [Mammal Hands - Quiet Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpC5NRhLbuM)
- [Mammal Hands - Hourglass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1GwbvxJ4aM)
- [GoGo Penguin - Raven\|Bardo\|Window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47XlUL6sRow)

## Anime
I have been following One Punch Man lately and a few friends suggested to watch these:  
- [Mob Psycho 100](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32182/Mob_Psycho_100)
  - I think this is by the same creators of One Punch Man. I only watched one episode and it was really good. From what I got from the first episode, this too, like OPM, has a overpowered protagonist. And there were so many good jokes in the first episode itself. I might watch it sometime later this week. But I have my GRE soon, so I don't know how much I will get to watch.
- [Devilman: Crybaby](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35120/Devilman__Crybaby)
  - The animation of this was really unexpected.

## Series
- [Barry](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5348176/)
  - I caught on the second season. And this is my favorite running show now. Beats GoT season 8 for me. ronny/lily was the most hilarious episode in this seasons although I think it has the least dialogue.
- I made my friends watch Doctor Who's Blink episode and they were as amazed as I was when I watched it the first time.

## Movies
Life of Pi rewatch.

## Books
Reading House of Leaves, on and off.  
Re-reading Infinite Jest.

## Misc
Exhausted my Poker credits, and so I can't play that for a while.  
Anki decks are awesome. I started creating a deck with vocab from Infinite Jest. (It's going to take a few months to complete that)  
Gwern's essays
