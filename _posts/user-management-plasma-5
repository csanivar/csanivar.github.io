If you are using `plasma 5` *and* not using any display managers *and* using `xinit` *and* not using any display manager (you are too cool for one anyway) *and* want to change the user information like user avatar, full name etc. the tool to use is [user-manager](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/user-manager/)
