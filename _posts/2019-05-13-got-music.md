All I wanted to say was that GoT has some really good music but I feel sad that it doesn't resolve strongly in the end.<br>  
[Light of the Seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS-gbqbVd8c) and [The Night King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1frgt0D_f4) are really good pieces of music which progress slowly building up the tension but their ending doesn't resolve that build-up.  
I realized that I have been trying to contrast these with [Tigran's Entertain Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK1ATwFt3YM), which has a very satisfying ending.  
In comparison, I think the GoT pieces end around the 8 minute mark of Entertain Me.  
But I guess being music for TV, they resolve the tension in the story rather than the music itself.

I have been listening to Entertain Me frequently these days and so this opinion may very well be biased.
