Master Mako was coming out of the chamber of silence when Nubi approached him and said:<br>

*Master, I am unable to grasp the usefulness of [Butter Knife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/). It does nothing special. I am quite skilled to do what it does. Why then should I use it Master?*

To this, the Master replied:

*I have novices do the chores not because I'm not skilled enough to do them.*

On hearing this, Nubi was enlightened.
